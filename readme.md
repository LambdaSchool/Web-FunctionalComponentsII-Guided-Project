# Objectives
  * Learn about importing and exporting components and styles.
  * Functional components are closures: they can access variables in the outer scope.
  * Implement a Nav component that consumes an array of link objects.
  * Implement a Section component that consumes an individual section.
  * Implement a top-level component that uses the other components.
  * Learn about props and how they are passed down.
  * Learn about the `key` prop when looping over an array with map.
  * Learn about top-level "container" elements that hold state.
  * Implement a button with a click handler.
  * Interpolate values from props in our JSX.
  * Learn to insert JS expressions inside our JSX to reduce verbosity.
  * Use semantic HTML in our components.
  * Functional components and the fat-arrow syntax.

# Final App
  * See the `design_files` folder.
  * Check the `solution` branch once the lecture is done.
